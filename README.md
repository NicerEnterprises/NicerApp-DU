# NicerApp-DU
NicerApp-WebOS latest version in stable many-dimensional form, with users interacting between eachother and the data, much like users in a shared folder filesystem online, but visualized in the Chrome Browser on websites ( already present in NicerApp-WebOS, which is the latest code running on https://nicer.app ).
